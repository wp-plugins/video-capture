Just add one of the following shortcodes at the page or post:

    [record_video align="right"]
    [record_video align="center"]

= Capturing Videos =

All your website visitors have to do is click on the button and a tool will open up activating their web camera, or in the case of mobile activating their mobile camera!

You can add a call to action before or after your shortcode for whatever purpose your heart desires.  Once the user clicks on the record button, and gives permission to the software to access their web camera the next steps are self-explanatory.

Downloading videos is quick and easy.

Simply login into your admin area of your WordPress site. Click on the link, in the left hand menu, called 'Video Capture'. This will open up a new page. On this page you see a list of all the videos that have been submitted to you. Depending on your browser you can either click on the link to download the video or right click on the link to download it. Once you have downloaded the video you can delete the video, off the server, by clicking the box next to the link and clicking the delete button on the bottom.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you support mobile? =

Yes, the plugin support the wide variety of mobile devices, including, but not
limited to: iPhone, iPod, iPad (different versions), Android-based phones,
Blackberry, Windows Phones.

= Do you store videos locally? =

To provide the best-in-class performance and reliability, we transparently
store videos at one of the popular CDN's. This also means that you don't
have to worry about your local storage size and you never run out of space!

= Why do you require Adobe Flash? =

At the moment, there is no way to *capture* video using HTML5, so we're using
Adobe Flash to capture input from your camera and microphone.

The plugin *doesn't* use Adobe Flash on mobile devices.
